# arduino-dw1000 (Enhanced Fork)

This is a fork and modernization of the original [thotro/arduino-dw1000](https://github.com/thotro/arduino-dw1000) library for the Decawave DW1000 UWB module. It introduces a centralized `DeviceManager` for robust handling of multi-device setups â€” especially **multi-anchor, single-tag** scenarios.

## ðŸš§ Project Status

**Active Development** â€” I got this fork to the point where I could use it complete my capstone project, which used 1 tag and 2 anchors for tracking a moving object in a 3d space: https://github.com/ThomasJM03/CSE450_453DustRunners

## ðŸ”§ Enhancements in This Fork

- âœ… **DeviceManager**: Manages anchors and tags with automatic activation/inactivation tracking, duplicate filtering, and reactivation.
- âœ… **Improved Multi-anchor Handling**: Seamless support for ranging from one tag to multiple anchors.(However it currently struggles to add device after the start up sequence)
- âœ… **Inactive Device Monitoring**: Automatically deactivates and recovers devices based on activity.
- âœ… **Enhanced Message Parsing**: More robust and readable message type detection.
- âœ… **Better Logging**: Improved debugging output for UWB interactions.

## ðŸ’¡ What You Can Do With This Fork

- Build reliable ranging networks with one tag and multiple anchors.
- Use `DeviceManager` to track device states and streamline ranging cycles.
- Extend or adapt for mesh or advanced topologies thanks to modular design.

## ðŸ§± Library Structure

### Core Components

| Class           | Description                                                                 |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `DW1000`        | Handles low-level configuration and SPI communication with the DW1000 chip. |
| `DW1000Time`    | Manages UWB-specific timestamp calculations and conversions.                |
| `DW1000Device`  | Encapsulates information about a remote device (anchor/tag).                |
| `DW1000Ranging` | Implements the ranging protocol (sending and receiving UWB messages).       |
| `DW1000Mac`     | MAC-level message formatting.                                               |
| `DeviceManager` | **New**: Centralized registry for remote devices (anchors/tags).            |

## ðŸš€ Usage

### Initialization Example

```cpp
#include <DW1000Ranging.h>

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(115200);

  DW1000Ranging.initCommunication();
  DW1000Ranging.startAsTag("82:17:5B:D5:A9:9A:E2:10", DW1000.MODE_LONGDATA_RANGE_LOWPOWER);

  DW1000Ranging.attachNewRange([](DW1000Device* device) {
    Serial.print("Range to ");
    Serial.print(device->getShortAddress(), HEX);
    Serial.print(" : ");
    Serial.print(device->getRange());
    Serial.println(" m");
  });
}
